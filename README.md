# Burnt Area Severity Assessment and Vegetation Dynamics Monitoring in Mt. Kenya Using Satellite Imagery and Google Earth Engine
## Abstract
In the recent years, wirlddires have frequently and increasingly posed a significant threat to the forest ecosystem. In Kenya, Mt. Kenya’s forest a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of Africa’s most important water towers, a critical ecosystem for biodiversity and water catchment, has experienced several wildfires over recent years. On the 10th, March 2019 is on of the most recent wildfire accorance on the region which have led to significant ecological and socio-economic impacts in the region, including biodiversity loss, changes in soil properties, and threats to water resources. 

### The main objectives of this study are:

To detect and map the extent of burnt areas in Mt. Kenya using satellite imagery in Google Earth Engine.
To assess burn severity by applying the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and other relevant indices.
To analyze post-fire vegetation changes satellite data.

This study will provide essential insights into the impact of wildfires on Mt. Kenya’s ecosystem, offering data-driven solutions for restoration efforts. The findings will aid policymakers and forest managers in making informed decisions on fire mitigation, forest rehabilitation, and sustainable land use practices.
